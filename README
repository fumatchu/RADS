(R)ocky (A)ctive (D)irectory (S)cript Builder

###############################################
RADS is NOW FULLY SUPPORTED ON 9.5 and 9.6 for a fresh install and also upgrades from previous versions of Samba
10 has not been tested yet-YMMV
###############################################
A walk-through can also be seen here:

This is a script to allow a Rocky (RHEL) Server (9.x) to become an AD/DC Server from Samba Source. 
Yes, there are others that build RPMS, but why not build it yourself?
I took this approach because there is not one binary that this script modifies and therefore can be a trusted source. 


####Pre-requisites
You should install Rocky from scratch. 
You should make sure the server has a static IP (If It does not, the installer will walk you through modifying it).
You do not need to (nor should you) install anything. Just a fresh, minimal install. The installer will do the rest for you. 


The Script will do the following:
  Validate that you have a static IP setup. If you do not it will prompt you.
  Sets SElinux
  Adds Firewall allowances
  Enable the Rocky REPOS needed to build 
    EPEL
    CRB 
Install the requirements needed by the samba source
    Modify chrony to point to 2.rocky.pool.ntp.org
    Download and install (Rocky) samba-latest (.src.rpm)
    Prompt you for domain provisioning
    Add the samba service and enable it 
    Clean up all the install files (We like to be tidy)
    Provide basic AD testing from the console
      Kerberos
      Kerberos udp (NS)
      LDAP (NS
      Anonymous login
      Authenticated Login
      
    Install a monitoring script to compare the version of compiled samba to upstream and alert you if
    an updated is needed
    update the .src.rpm to latest version
    Provide you with a "next steps" for samba administration
        Suggest a reverse zone from the command line after install, based on your topology
        Provide examples for password complexity, history, etc
        Provide default user creation command to create your first AD user

####Sounds great! How do I get it?
